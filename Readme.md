Upcoming Events:
Show a calendar view and conflicted dates. 

Goals (Completed):
* Demonstrate functional programming
* Separation of concerns
* Separate sectoins for each Day
* MVP pattern EvenLogicController
* Reusable genercised class for adapting CollectionView to data in model. 
* Avoids forced unwraps for view controllers by creating a LazyLoaded section which is called after viewDidLoad
* Designed for network access by async call, although not required in project
* Lazy loaded DateFormatters that should only get created once, as they are expensive to create. 

Streach Goals (Partially done, can finish if you like)
* Do a customized layout to show conflicted items and layout the items
    * Have data grouped by an array which shows the conflicted Events
    * Ran out of time to get the custom UICollectionViewLayout working although a lot of the support
    code is in there.
